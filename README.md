This Git is dedicated to course IAS0220 which is Robots software and its controls.

Given course main objective is the introduction of ROS. Mainly on how to create a robot from scratch and give it attributes so that we can simulate its movements and actions in any given space.

The course is diveded into multiple tasks:

1) Understanding how ROS connects all the packages so that the robot can be properly simulated. After that is the actual creation of the "physical" robot using urdf. Also to help visual the robot better we are using rviz. Llearning the use of Xarco macros tro try clean up the code a bit.

2) Understanding the connections between ROS nodes and topics. Using ROS topics command line arguments. Creating a new package soley for the purpose of node and topic communication. Makeing the nodes communicate with eachother.

3) Making the robot move using package teleop_twist_keyboard node and the package Transform_frame move node.

4) Adding attributes to the robots pieces for more accurate simulations

5) ...
